# Changelog

## v0.2.2 - 2026-11-03

- Internal `/internal/` polls are counted and summarised once a minute instead of logged per call (wfc-common v0.3.1).

## v0.2.1 - 2026-11-03

- Every HTTP request now logs one line to stderr, `http <method> <path> -> <status> <ms>ms` (path only, never the query, headers or bodies; `/healthz` skipped), through wfc-common v0.3.0 `httplog`. Covers the HTTP and HTTPS console listeners.
